# Twitter

In this directory is a file, `tweets.txt`, containing a bunch of tweets. Each tweet is contained on one line.  Some tweets have hashtags. The hashtags consist of some sequence of non-whitespace characters, such as `#so-damn-blessed...`

Implement `search_for_hashtag` in [problem.py](./problem.py), such that there are no failures when you run `python problem.py`.
